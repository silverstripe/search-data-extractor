# Search Data Extractor

## Overview

This module provides a RESTful like API to expose data from pages and other
content objects to search engines as JSON.

**Note:**
This does not come with built-in classes or extensions to expose any objects by
default.

After installing the module, you will need a developer to create custom
"schemas" for each object you wish to expose based on the search engines'
requirements for each type of object.

A basic example can be found in the [Developer documentation](docs/en/index.md).
